# Meeting Notes 10/10/18

Discussion on Plan-Property Dependencies 1 and 2.

### What is a plan property?
A function that takes as input an action sequence and a task and outputs a Boolean value. It is computable in polyomial time with respect to the input.

### What is a dependency?
- Between two properties, p and q, an atomic dependendency is an entailment: p implies q.
- More complex dependenicies might comprise arbitrary Boolean formulae of plan properties.

### Composed plan properties.
While particular Boolean formulae of atomic plan properties can be encapsulated as a single plan property, from the algorithmic point of view it will best be treated as atomic properties.
