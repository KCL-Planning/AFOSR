\begin{abstract}
A key problem in explainable AI planning is to elucidate decision
rationales. User questions in this context are often contrastive,
taking the form ``Why do A rather than B?''. Answering such a question
requires a statement about the space of possible plans. We propose to
do so through plan-property dependencies, where plan properties are
Boolean properties of plans the user is interested in, and
dependencies are entailment relations in plan space. The answer to the
above question then consists of those properties C entailed by B. We
introduce a formal framework for such dependency analysis. We
instantiate and operationalize that framework for the case of
dependencies between goals in oversubscription planning.
%
% Joerg: the nogood learning is after all not super important for
% performance; whereas the compilations really are central to this
% paper.
%
%% , leveraging and extending recent nogood learning methods for
%% computational efficiency. We show that more general plan properties
%% can be compiled into this special case.
%
More powerful plan properties can be compiled into that special case.
%
We show experimentally that, in a variety of benchmarks, the suggested
analyses can be feasible and produce compact answers for human
inspection.

%\joerg{TODO:}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Rebecca: get RCP benchmarks from Marcel (3 domains), add corresponding table rows to Figure 1, in separate part at bottom
%\item Rebecca: add to data on the meta search tree: 1. size of the search tree ie number of nodes (of planning tasks) solved, as a function of the cost bound; 2. (average) time-per-node in that search tree, as a function of the cost bound and the planner.  As the cost bound grows, 1. should get smaller while 2. should get larger.
%\item Rebecca: add data on the size of the dominant PDO ie the number of MUGS. this could go together with the previous item.
%\item Marcel: try trap learning techniques, on fig 1 benchmarks as well as on new benchmarks with action constraints; see if tghey do better than hC learning / try to improve performance by navigating his algorithm configuration space
%\item Rebecca \& Michael: design and run action-constraint experiments where original goals are hard; full cost bound; number of action constraints added is scaled from 1 to N (a priori, given a fixed order of action constraints, unless it turns out to be crucial for performance which of these constraints are added).
%\item Perhaps later depending on outcome of previous item: design experiments where both the number of original goals and that of action constraints are scaled (2 dimensions); plus where suitable different cost bounds.
%% \item Later: include some data also on LTL compilation. (might decide to remove this from paper later on depending on results and space, but let's keep it in for now)
%\item Rebecca/Michael: check out the IPC net-benefit benchmarks. Reviewers may naturally expect us to experiment with those, given our strong focus on oversubscription planning (actually this question came up in the discussion with the NASA guys yesterday). In the net-bnefit benchmarks, goal facts have rewards which we don't need. The question is whether, stripping away these rewards and imposing a plan-cost bound, we would get benchmarks not already covered by bour IPC experiments anyway. If the answer is "no", we can just say so in the paper. If the answer is "yes", it would be good (though probably not absolitely necessary) to experiment with these domains as well. In any case, we should know what the answer is.
%\item Rebecca/Marcel: experiment with bottom-up construction of minimal unsolvable goal sets, starting at empty set and adding more goals until unsat?
