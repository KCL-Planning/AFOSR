Planning task $\cal T$, set $A$ of actions. A plan in $\cal T$ is any structure over $A$ that serves as a specification of what to do (e.g. a sequence or partially ordered set). Denote by $\Pi$ the set of all plans in $\cal T$.

\begin{definition}[Plan Property]
Given a planning task $\cal T$, a plan property $p$ in $\cal T$ is any function $p : \Pi \mapsto \{true, false\}$ that can be computed in time polynomial in the size of its input.
\end{definition}
