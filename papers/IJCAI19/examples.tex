\subsection{Nomystery}

\subsubsection*{Explanation Domain}
The goal in nomystery is to deliver packages from a initial location (labeled in red)
to a goal location (labeled in green). There are two trucks with a separate fuel level.
The amount of packages a truck can transport is not limited. A truck can either load or 
unload a package or drive from one to an other location. Loading and unloading costs no fuel,
driving costs between 1 and 5 fuels units (label at the edges).\\

Properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item don't use $T_i$ $(L_x,L_y)$: Truck $T_i$ should not drive from $L_x$ to
		$L_y$ or vise versa
	\item use $T_i$ $(L_x,L_y)$: Truck $T_i$ should drive at least once from $L_x$ to
		$L_y$ or vise versa
	\item same truck $P_x$ $P_y$: both packages have to be delivered by the same truck
		(the packages are either only loaded and an unloaded by truck $T_0$ or by $T_1$)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example 1}
%\begin{figure}
	The fuel limit is 1.5 times the minimal limit to deliver all packages.

	Initial fuel:
	$fuel(T_0) = 16$, $fuel(T_1) = 7$

\subsection{Blocksworld}

The cost bound is set to 11, 0.5 times the minimal cost to solve all goals.
You can pick up and put down a block from the table and stack and unstack two blocks.
Each of these actions costs 1.
