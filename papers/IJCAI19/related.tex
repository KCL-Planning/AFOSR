\joerg{I normally don't include sections like this, as I find them
  boring; I usually just cover the brod literature context in the
  intro, and specific relations at those technical places where they
  are pertinent. Here though, matters may be different in that, in the
  intro, we can and should only spin the stroy for XAIP and perhaps
  domain analysis; while at the technical level people may wonder if
  what we do here concretely is not just a work on oversubscription
  planning. So we may want to add a section here discussing technical
  and conceptual relations to works -- in oversubscription planning,
  and also in conflict analysis see pointers below -- which are not
  naturally part of the XAIP story in the intro.}

Related work by Brian Williams (need to find citations): reasoning
about user goals; oversubscription planning in constraint-based
planning formulation; suggest goals to drop based on conflict
analysis; constructive procedure to find these goals, given commitment
(subset of goals) and most important implications (subsets of other
goals dropping which makes the whole thing consistent ie goal
achievable). In short, the service provided is related to that
provided by our goalfact dependency analysis; but in a
direct/constructive manner, as opposed to our meta search tree, as
enabled by working in a constraint formulation and building on
conflict analysis in that setting.

Related work by Philippe Laborie? resource constrained planning ixtet
have some form of conflict analysis with critical set for resources
consumption, relates to our analysis in goal facts RCP?
