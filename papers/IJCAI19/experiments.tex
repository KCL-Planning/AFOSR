\section{Experiments}

We implemented our approach in Fast Downward (FD) \cite{helmert:jair-06}.  

\joerg{tentative plan, to simplify presentation and focus on the 
main messages rather than algorothm-configuration space: use hFF
throughout, and vary SysW (aka top-down) vs SysS (aka bottom-up)
throughout; on IPC benchmarks, vary hC on vs off, where ``on'' means
to include transfer; on action-set prop experiments, vary traps on vs
off, where ``on'' means to include transfer. ... Rebecca to generate
the missing data for IPC and nomystery, then we'll check and if it
looks ok use this.}

\joerg{Rebecca/Michael: check out the IPC net-benefit benchmarks. Reviewers may naturally expect us to experiment with those, given our strong focus on oversubscription planning (actually this question came up in the discussion with the NASA guys yesterday). In the net-bnefit benchmarks, goal facts have rewards which we don't need. The question is whether, stripping away these rewards and imposing a plan-cost bound, we would get benchmarks not already covered by bour IPC experiments anyway. If the answer is "no", we can just say so in the paper. If the answer is "yes", it would be good (though probably not absolitely necessary) to experiment with these domains as well. In any case, we should know what the answer is.}
