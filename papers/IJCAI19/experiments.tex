\section{Experiments}

We implemented our approach in Fast Downward (FD) \cite{helmert:jair-06}.  
\rebecca{Genral setting of experiments, timeout memory, processor ...}

\joerg{tentative plan, to simplify presentation and focus on the 
main messages rather than algorothm-configuration space: use hFF
throughout, and vary SysW (aka top-down) vs SysS (aka bottom-up)
throughout; on IPC benchmarks, vary hC on vs off, where ``on'' means
to include transfer; on action-set prop experiments, vary traps on vs
off, where ``on'' means to include transfer. ... Rebecca to generate
the missing data for IPC and nomystery, then we'll check and if it
looks ok use this.}

\joerg{Rebecca/Michael: check out the IPC net-benefit benchmarks. Reviewers may naturally expect us to experiment with those, given our strong focus on oversubscription planning (actually this question came up in the discussion with the NASA guys yesterday). In the net-bnefit benchmarks, goal facts have rewards which we don't need. The question is whether, stripping away these rewards and imposing a plan-cost bound, we would get benchmarks not already covered by bour IPC experiments anyway. If the answer is "no", we can just say so in the paper. If the answer is "yes", it would be good (though probably not absolitely necessary) to experiment with these domains as well. In any case, we should know what the answer is.}

\subsubsection*{Oversubscription IPC Domains}

As a benchmark we used a oversubscription version of the optimal STRIPS IPC domains \rebecca{cite} up to
IPC'18. It includes all instances which are solvable with a 30 min timeout and 4 GB of 
memory limit by $A^*$ with \emph{lmcut} and have less then 31 goal facts. 
The goals fact limitation is introduced by the duplicate checking of the sub-goals.
We introduced a cost bound by scaling the optimal cost with $0.25$, $0.5$ and $0.75$.

The base planner configurations, used to solve/prove unsolvebility of a meta search node,
are greedy best first search with $h^{\text{ff}}$ and preferred operators ($h^{\text{ff}}$) and  
conjunction learning $h^C$ with $h^{\text{ff}}$ as its base heuristic. \rebecca{ask Marcel how it is called}
\rebecca{Modification of hC to find deadends with an cost bound}

The results are displayed in Table \ref{table:coverage_ipc}.
We compare the coverage to two baselines, the number of instances which are solved by \emph{lmcut} without
a cost bound (left column in the baseline part) and the number of instances which are proved
unsolvable with all goals given the corresponding cost bound (right columns in the baseline part). 
The second baseline corresponds to the first node in the \emph{SysW} search tree.
