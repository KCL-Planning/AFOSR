\begin{abstract}
In many usage scenarios of AI Planning technology, users will want not
just a plan $\pi$ but an explanation of the space of possible plans,
justifying $\pi$. In particular, in oversubscription planning where
not all goals can be achieved, users may ask why a conjunction $A$ of
goals is not achieved by $\pi$. We propose to answer this kind of
question with the goal conjunctions $B$ excluded by $A$, \ie, that
could not be achieved were $A$ enforced. We formalize this approach in
terms of plan-property dependencies, where plan properties are
propositional formulas over the goals achieved by a plan, and
dependencies are entailment relations in plan space. We introduce
algorithms for identifying dependencies of the form $\bigwedge_{g \in
A} g \Rightarrow \neg \bigwedge_{g \in B} g$, \emph{globally} across a
given set of plan properties, or \emph{locally} computing the
implications of a single given plan property (user question)
$\bigwedge_{g \in A} g$. We show how, via compilation, one can analyze
dependencies between a richer form of plan properties, referring to
the action subsets touched by the plan. We run comprehensive
experiments on adapted IPC benchmarks, and find that the suggested
analyses are reasonably feasible at the global level, and become
significantly more effective at the local level.

%% A key problem in explainable AI planning is to elucidate decision
%% rationales. User questions in this context are often contrastive,
%% taking the form ``Why do A rather than B?'' \joerg{bit of a mismatch
%%   between this and the ``properties'' B and C below}. Answering such a
%% question requires a statement about the space of possible plans. We
%% propose to do so through plan-property dependencies, where plan
%% properties are Boolean properties of plans the user is interested in,
%% and dependencies are entailment relations in plan space. The answer to
%% the above question then consists of those properties C entailed by
%% B. We introduce a formal framework for such dependency analysis. We
%% instantiate and operationalize that framework for the case of
%% dependencies between goals in oversubscription planning.

%% %% computational efficiency. We show that more general plan properties

%% More powerful plan properties can be compiled into that special case.

%% We show experimentally that, in a variety of benchmarks, the suggested
%% analyses can be feasible and produce compact answers for human
%% inspection.
