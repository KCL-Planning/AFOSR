%%   checking.}

%% I normally don't include sections like this, as I find them boring;
%%   I usually just cover the brod literature context in the intro,
%%   and specific relations at those technical places where they are
%%   pertinent. Here though, matters may be different in that, in the
%%   intro, we can and should only spin the stroy for XAIP and perhaps
%%   domain analysis; while at the technical level people may wonder
%%   if what we do here concretely is not just a work on
%%   oversubscription planning. So we may want to add a section here
%%   discussing technical and conceptual relations to works -- in
%%   oversubscription planning, and also in conflict analysis see
%%   pointers below -- which are not naturally part of the XAIP story
%%   in the intro. ... TBD when writing the introduction}

Various works relate to our computation of MUGS. In SAT/CP, minimal
unsatisfiable cores (MUC, \eg\ \cite{chinneck:2007,laborie:ecai-14})
are related to MUGS, though at the technical level this is quite
different as it relies on constraint-conflict analysis methods and is
non-exhaustive, \ie, does not aim at finding \emph{all}
MUCs. Similarly, in the temporal planner IxTeT, a sub-procedure
analyzing resource conflicts finds minimal critical sets (effects
over-consuming a resource) \cite{laborie:ghallab:ijcai-95}. On the
exhaustive side, problems and algorithms involving some form of
solvability borderline within a lattice of problem variants have been
considered since a long time
(\eg\ \cite{dekleer:ai-86:atms,reiter:ai-87}). The closest relation to
our MUGS analysis is a diagnosis framework that can cast maximum
solvable goal subsets as preferred diagnoses
\cite{grastien:etal:kr-12}. While that work uses SAT technology where
we use a base planner, in general ideas for search enhancements may be
transferrable between the two algorithms (in both directions).

There are two works \cite{yu:etal:jair-17,lauffer:topcu:xaip-19} that
aim at suggesting goals to drop in oversubscribed situations. This can
be viewed as a kind of user information complementary to our local and
global explanations. At the technical level, both works are quite
different from ours as they use constraint-based problem encodings.

We remark that our approach can be viewed as a form of domain/task
analysis, or as a form of model checking applied to planning
models. Both have been explored before, but addressing very different
problems
(\eg\ \cite{fox:long:jair-98,rintanen:aaai-00,vaquero:etal:keq-13}).

%% %% $p$ is a landmark \cite{hoffmann:etal:jair-04} iff $\true$ entails

%% %% \joerg{discuss relation to domain analysis / model checking?
%% %%   basically, our approach can be viewed as a form of domain analysis
%% %%   checking the truth of formulas over plan space. it seems to me that
%% %%   ``domain analysis'' should definitely be mentioned in our
%% %%   introduction, as another frame of reference besides
%% %%   XAIP. ... regarding model checking, our analysis can be viewed as a
%% %%   systematic form of checking a set of properties of interest; we
%% %%   structure this form of analysis as makes sense in explainable
%% %%   planning; computationally we exploit synergies in addressing the
%% %%   entire set of properties rather than checking each possible
%% %%   dependency in isolation; in the long-term, a highly relevant
%% %%   research line is how to discover relevant properties in the first
%% %%   place. ... as a concrete literature link, I know that some people
%% %%   from Brasil worked on using model checkers as a domaiun analysis
%% %%   tool, in the ICKEPS context; but I don't have the concrete
%% %%   references in mind/ don't know whether and where this has been
%% %%   published. ... we could perhaps mention in this context (currently
%% %%   mentioned in my text snippet below, but this could be moved
%% %%   elsewhere) that ultimately one may want to identify interesting plan
%% %%   properties automatically, which is then clearly beyond anything
%% %%   addressed in model checking.}
