\paragraph{verbalizing plans}

	Comment: I was thinking about the plan verbalization work from Manuela Veloso's group 
	-- e.g. \url{https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/127.pdf} 
	-- and realized there may be some interesting connections here. 
	Granted these are different kinds of plans, motion plans versus plans in general, 
	but...  I wonder if an approach like in this paper can be a better alternative 
	to the template approach in the verbalization work. For example, a PDO versus 
	a concrete PDO could help with "specificity" while planning models do have 
	a rich literature of abstractions that can be readily leveraged in this framework. 
	I guess the point is if it is useful automating the templatization using plan properties. 
	Maybe something to think about...
